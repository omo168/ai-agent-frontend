I've created a comprehensive multi-AI chat application with the following features:

Key Features
Multiple AI Providers: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI models 
Dynamic Model Selection: Switch between different models within each provider
Real-time Streaming: Uses the AI SDK's streaming capabilities for responsive chat 
Modern UI: Clean, responsive design with provider-specific branding
Message Management: Copy messages, clear chat history
Loading States: Visual feedback during AI responses
Keyboard Shortcuts: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new lines
Setup Instructions
Install Dependencies:

npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/google
Configure API Keys: Copy .env.local.example to .env.local and add your API keys

The application provides a seamless experience for comparing responses from different AI providers and models, making it perfect for testing, development, or general AI assistance needs.
